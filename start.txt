Cloning Remote Repository into Local Machine
	GitHub
		Repository
			(We call it) Remote Repository
					Since it is a Repository,it has .git folder
						We want this Repository (.git folder along with all other content) to be copied into our Local Machine
							To do that,
								In our Local Machine
									We will pick a Working Directory Of Our Choice
										And There, we will invoke git clone command
											Once you do that, the .git folder along with all other content from Remote Repository Will Be Copied
											as it is to our Working Directory.
												
										Along with it, what happens on our behalf?
											Two Way RelationShip is formed by this clone command.
											Config File Of Local Repository gets updated with Location of Remote Repository.
											So, if we make some changes to Local Repository and try to push, git will know in that case, where to push.
											
											This Remote Repository Location is referred by a parameter called origin.
											
											This is the reason why, you see following message when you invoke git status:
												Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
												origin -> Refers Remote Repository
												master -> Branch
												
												Example:
												$ git status
												On branch master
												Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
												
												nothing to commit, working tree clean
